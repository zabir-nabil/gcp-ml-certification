# gcp-ml-certification
A study guide for preparing for the GCP Professional Machine Learning Certification in one week or less.

# 7-Day Plan

* **Day 1-2**: Start by skimming through **"Journey to Become a Google Cloud Machine Learning Engineer: Build the mind and hand of a Google Certified ML professional"** on the first day. Highlight sections you're less familiar with. On the second day, focus on reading these marked sections. This book provides a broad overview of GCP, ML, and how ML works in GCP. It's a great starting point, but it won't be enough for exam preparation on its own.
  
* **Day 3**: Review the official [Certification Exam Guide](https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification/guides/machine-learning-engineer). Dive into the GCP documentation for each topic listed there. Understanding every service or technology in depth isn't necessary; you should focus more on their overviews, use cases, and how they integrate with other services.

* **Day 4-5**: Work through as many labs as you can from the [Machine Learning Engineer Learning Path](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/17). Watch related videos at double speed, but feel free to skip the longer ones. Make sure to complete all the quizzes.

* **Day 6**: Tackle [sample questions](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeYmkCANE81qSBqLW0g2X7RoskBX9yGYQu-m1TtsjMvHabGqg/viewform). You can find additional GCP ML practice questions on YouTube, [gcp-examquestions.com](https://www.gcp-examquestions.com/), and [examtopics.com](https://www.examtopics.com/). I also tried using [skillcertpro.com](https://skillcertpro.com/product/google-machine-learning-engineer-exam-questions/), but found that many of their questions were repetitive and some answers incorrect, so I wouldn't recommend it.

* **Day 7**: Spend this day reviewing everything you've learned. This is a good time to revisit any topics that are still unclear and solidify your understanding.
